# OE5510
The Project is aimed to estimate the subsurface thermal structure in Indian ocean with surface variables such as SST and SSS by establishing a supervised machine learning model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor(XGBR) method. I attempted to use only the in-situ data that was obtained from one source(argo) without scaling the data to develop a XGBR model.
